# PasswordProtectionProject

This is a simple python script which password protects your pictures so only you can view them. Once you run the .exe file you will be asked if you are a new user and then be promted to create a password. Then you will be asked what you want to. The current options are add a picture, show a picture, quit the program, and show the menu. Once you add a picture you can delete the picture from your disc and when you run the .exe once again you can view your picture with your password and the name which you saved it under. List of pictures coming soon!
