# PasswordProtectionProject

This is a simple python script which password protects your pictures so only you can view them. Once you run the .exe file you will be asked if you are a new user and then be promted to create a password. Then you will be asked what you want to. The current options are add a picture, show a picture, quit the program, and show the menu. Once you add a picture you can delete the picture from your disc and when you run the .exe once again you can view your picture with your password and the name which you saved it under. List of pictures coming soon!

Downloading Instructions:
    Download the Directory.exe file and run the program. You don't need python installed on your computer and this .exe file works with linux, mac, and windows. 

I have also attached the Directory.py to show my source code if anyone is interested.
(OLD Directory Source.py is the old source code before the update)

UPDATE (7/5/20):
    Added a menu option to show all the images saved so far
    Fixed some minor password errors
